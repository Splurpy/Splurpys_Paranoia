**Paranoia Mod Early Alpha**

NOTE: This project is currently on hold, and I may resume working on it sometime in the future.
I'm taking time to focus on my professional education and experience.

This mod aims to add:
- Sanity gameplay system that changes based on in-game actions and events
- Ways to configure said sanity system
- New mobs (Prowler, Peeper, Etc.)

- Many features have been added in early renditions
